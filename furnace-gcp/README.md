# Google Cloud

Google Cloud integration is a work in progress. Expect further update as it continue to be implemented.

Currently the supported and fully functional commands are:

```bash
❯ ./furnace-gcp help
create custom-config             Create a Google Deployment Manager
deleteDeployment custom-config   Delete a Google Deployment Manager
status [--config=configFile]     Get the status of an existing Deployment Management group.
update custom-config [-y]        Update updates a Google Deployment
help [command]                   Display this help or a command specific help
```

## Authentication with Google

Please carefully read and follow the instruction outlined in this document: [Google Cloud Getting Started](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#Quick_Start). It will describe how to download and install the SDK and initialize cloud to a Project Name and ID.

Take special attention to these documents:

[Initializing GCloud Tools](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing)
[Authorizing Tools](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing)

Furnace uses a Google Key-File to authenticate with your Google Cloud Account and Project.
In the future, Furnace assumes these things are properly set up and in working order.

## Deployment Manager

Furnace uses Google Cloud's [Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/) service.
This service is similar to AWS' CloudFormation. It utilizes a YAML based configuration file and templates.
Templates use Python's [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) which is a fully featured template engine.

### Templates

You can find a LOT of good templates samples located here: [GloudPlatform Deployment Samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples). Furnace provides two examples. A simpler example can be seen in `./templates/google_template.yaml`. It will create a simple architecture with Load Balancing and Auto Scaling and deploy a Go Web App sample application located here: [Go Simple Wiki](https://github.com/Skarlso/furnace-google-cloud-app). It's Go's simple Wiki example app.

If deployed successfully, you should be able to access it like this:

![success](./img/working_go_app.png).

The second example can be located in `./templates/google_template.bookshelf.yaml`. This example deploys Google's sample Python App located here: [Python Getting Started](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/getting-started-python/tree/master/7-gce).

### Furnace Config

In order to tell furnace which template to use, simply create the following configuration file structure...

```
.
├── stacks
│   ├── google_template.yaml
│   ├── simple_template.jinja
│   └── gcp_furnace_config.yaml
└── .teststack.furnace
```

### Configuring a Deployment

*Note: The following section describes how to deploy the sample Go application.*

#### Setup

Project-ID should be set to your desired project name's ID with which to work with.

#### Update the template

Everything else, like region, is configured through the provided Google Templates. All attached `includes` and schema files are automatically added to the configuration. They should, however, live next to the template.

#### Startup Script

##### Store your startup script in a bucket

A startup script is what's used in order to bootstrap the instances. Furnace doesn't interpolate a script if it is attached, so rather use a bucket which contains the startup script and use `startup-script-url` template variable to define its location like this:

```yaml
      metadata:
        items:
          - key: startup-script-url
            value: gs://{{ properties["bucket"] }}/startup-script.sh
```

##### In-line with import

Right now, furnace doesn't provide an import from a schema file. A future version will have that luxury. The sample bookshelf template contains an example of that.

##### Raw in-line

You could always just in-line the script in the template directly.

## Creating a Deployment

After everything has been properly configure, execute:

```bash
./furnace-gcp create
```

This will display information like this:

```bash
~/golang/src/github.com/go-furnace/go-furnace extend_with_subcommand*
❯ ./furnace-gcp create
2017/11/03 07:14:47 Creating Deployment under project name: . testplatform-180405
2017/11/03 07:14:47 Deployment name is:  furnace-stack
2017/11/03 07:14:47 Found the following import files:  [{./simple_template.jinja simple_template.jinja}]

```

## Update a Deployment

Updating a deployment happens by calling `update stackname`. This will being the update process of a deployment.

It will put the deployment into the `Preview` state first. At this stage, nothing is comited yet. You have the option
to view the would be created resources and after you find that everything is in order, hit `y` and apply the changes.

For further details, please consult this document [GCP Update Deployment](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/deployments/updating-deployments).

```bash
./furnace-gcp update
```

This will display information like this:

```bash
 $ ./furnace-gcp update teststack

2019/09/18 22:28:56 Creating Deployment update under project name: . furnace-253212
[\] Waiting for state: DONE
2019/09/18 22:29:12 Please review the preview data.
Would you like to apply the changes? (y/N):y
[/] Waiting for state: DONE
{"id":"1234",....}
```

If n is choosen on the update, the Preview will be cancelled and the deployment is put back into running state.

## Deleting a Deployment

Once the stack is no longer needed, run the following command:

```bash
./furnace-gcp delete
```

Which will output this information:

```bash
~/golang/src/github.com/go-furnace/go-furnace extend_with_subcommand* 51s
❯ ./furnace-gcp delete
2017/11/03 07:17:38 Deleteing Deployment Under Project:  testplatform-180405
[-] Waiting for state: DONE
Stack terminated!
```

## Status of Deployment

Status can be retrieved using the following command:

```bash
./furnace-gcp status
```

This will output information about the deployment including the manifest file which includes all of the created resources with the deployment. This will look like the following output:


```bash
~/golang/src/github.com/go-furnace/go-furnace extend_with_subcommand* 1m 8s
❯ ./furnace-gcp status
2017/11/01 21:37:39 Status of Deployment under project name: . testplatform-180405
